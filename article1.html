                As a parent coach, I’ve witnessed the challenges parents face when their adult children are struggling.
                The line between helping and enabling can be slim. I have seen many well-meaning parents throw on their
                super parent cape and fly off in an attempt to ease their child’s pain. But rescuing too much can
                prevent growth, while healthy support builds resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s explore two real-life scenarios that illustrate this delicate balance.

                The Overextended Supporter

            </h3>
            <p>
                Leslie’s son, Jasper, at 26, had a history of quitting jobs after a few months. His reasons
                varied—“toxic environments,” “unfair management”—but Leslie’s solution was always the same: Pay his rent
                and let him regroup. Jasper’s career ambitions, however, remained stagnant, and Leslie felt like she was
                drowning in guilt when she didn’t help.


            </p>
            <p>
                Leslie’s love for Jasper was evident, but she inadvertently enabled his lack of direction. By continuing
                to offer financial support without clear expectations, she prevented him from facing the consequences
                and taking responsibility for his future.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                Leslie could have helped Jasper create a realistic budget and job-search plan
                instead of paying rent. As I describe in my book <em>10 Days to a Less Defiant Child,</em> providing
                emotional support and practical tools to struggling adult children empowers them to take ownership of
                their situation.

                The Tough-Love Parent
            </h3>
            <p>
                Greg’s daughter Marnie, 29, was an artist with dreams of opening a studio. Greg had invested heavily in
                her vision, giving her a lump sum to fund her business. However, Marnie spent more time on social media
                than on actual work, and the company was going nowhere fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                Greg was frustrated. He loved his daughter but realized that his financial support wasn’t having the
                intended effect—it was enabling her procrastination. After a tough conversation, Greg offered a
                different kind of help: He would match any funds she saved but wouldn’t give her another penny unless
                she showed real effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                Greg’s approach allowed Marnie to take ownership of her business, setting boundaries that
                encouraged her to work harder and be more responsible.

                How to Help Without Enabling
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Define What Support Looks Like.
                        </strong>
                        Support doesn’t have to mean solving every problem. For Leslie, this meant shifting from paying
                        Jasper’s rent to helping him create a budget and explore job opportunities. Instead of footing
                        the bill, she offered emotional encouragement and practical tools, empowering him to take
                        ownership of his situation.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong>Tip:</strong>
                        When your child asks for help, ask yourself: Am I doing this to alleviate their struggle or my
                        discomfort? If it’s the latter, consider a different approach.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Stop Feeling Guilty About Saying No</strong>
                        It’s OK to say no when your financial, emotional, or other resources are depleted. Greg learned
                        this the hard way. He set a boundary with Marnie, offering to match her savings
                        dollar-for-dollar instead of funding her outright. At first, she bristled, but over time, she
                        began to take her goals more seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tip:</strong>
                        Frame your “no” to say “yes” to their growth. For example, “I can’t fund this project, but I
                        believe in you and am happy to brainstorm ways you can make it work.”

                    <p>
                        <strong>Respect Their Independence (Even If It’s Messy).</strong>
                        Sometimes, watching your child struggle is more complicated than stepping in. But growth often
                        comes from trial and error. It wasn't glamorous when Jasper finally found a job, but it gave him
                        a sense of pride. Leslie realized that her stepping back allowed him to step up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tip:</strong>
                        Resist the urge to micromanage. Instead, offer unconditional support: “I’m here for you, no
                        matter what.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Take Care of Yourself.</strong>
                        Putting your child’s needs above your own is easy as a parent. But when you’re running on empty,
                        you’re less effective at providing the kind of support they truly need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tip:</strong>
                        Prioritize activities and relationships that replenish you. Remember, modeling self-care is one
                        of the most valuable lessons you can offer your child.

                Final Thoughts
            </h3>
            <p>
                Parenting doesn’t stop when your child turns 18; it evolves. When you set boundaries, you’re not
                withholding love but redefining it. You’re teaching your child to navigate challenges while preserving
                your well-being.
            </p>
