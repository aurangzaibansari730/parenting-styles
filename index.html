                Parenting Styles
            </h3>
            <p>
                It is a stereotype that, in therapy, all of a person’s problems will be blamed on their parents. That is
                not the case. But decades of psychological research have suggested that the approach to parenting
                generally followed by an individual’s mother and/or father can influence the way they approach
                relationships, challenges, and opportunities. That doesn’t mean that an adult can’t change, of course,
                especially once they understand what may be influencing their behavior. And parents who become aware of
                the pitfalls of their own style and how it may affect their kids can also change.

                What are the four major parenting styles?

            </h3>
            <p>
                Research begun by developmental psychologist Diana Baumrind in the 1960s identified three main parenting
                styles—authoritarian, indulgent, and authoritative. Later studies added a fourth—neglectful. Every
                parent does not neatly fit into one of these four categories but they describe the approaches of many.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            An authoritarian parent
                        </strong>
                        seeks to maintain a high level of control over their children. They may set and adhere to a
                        strict set of rules, and are more likely to support and take part in corporal punishment such as
                        spanking. Children of highly authoritarian parents may struggle socially and may be likely to
                        become authoritarian parents themselves.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Neglectful parents (also known as uninvolved or disengaged)
                        </strong>
                        take on a limited parenting role. They may not spend as much time as other parents in
                        conversation, play, or other activities, and may not bother to set many house rules. Some
                        children of neglectful parents may resist rules outside of the home and struggle with
                        self-control.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Indulgent (or permissive) parents
                        </strong>
                        may be attentive and warm, but may not set many rules for their children. They may prioritize
                        being their child’s friend over being their parent. Research suggests that the children of
                        permissive parents may show higher levels of creativity but may also feel entitled, and be more
                        interested in taking rather than giving in their own relationships.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Authoritative parents
                        </strong>
                        follow what is widely understood as the preferred approach. Such parents are more pragmatic and
                        flexible. They set clear boundaries but also encourage children’s independence within those
                        limits. Discipline in such families may be more supportive than punitive, and as children get
                        older, their independence increases. Children of authoritative parents may have more highly
                        developed self-control and self-reliance.
