                Social media platforms—such as social networks, messaging apps, and blogs—have become an integral part
                of daily life, offering opportunities for social interaction, information sharing, and emotional
                support. Although these platforms provide numerous benefits, excessive use of them can lead to
                addiction, with users exhibiting symptoms comparable to those experienced in substance addiction (i.e.,
                activity salience, mood modification, tolerance, conflict with others, withdrawal symptoms, and relapse
                ). This risk is particularly concerning during adolescence, a formative period when social media habits
                are established, potentially setting the stage for addictive behaviors in adulthood. Given that parents
                are key figures in their children’s socialization, parental involvement—particularly in terms of
                monitoring and conflict—may influence the development of social media addiction. However, most studies
                to date are cross-sectional, limiting the understanding of whether these effects persist into adulthood.
                Given the evolving nature of social media, it is important to study the long-term impact of social media
                use.

                In a 15-year longitudinal study described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/cbs0000428">an article
                    published</a> in the <em>Canadian Journal of Behavioral Science / Revue Canadienne des sciences du
                    comportement</em>, Demers et al. address this gap by examining the relationships between parental
                monitoring and conflicts during adolescence, chat site use by 15-year-olds, the social media involvement
                of 25-year-olds, and social media addiction of 30-year-olds. As part of a broader longitudinal project
                investigating various aspects of social development from early adolescence to adulthood, data were
                collected from 322 participants through questionnaires at three key developmental stages: adolescence
                (age 15 years), emerging adulthood (age 25 years), and adulthood (age 30 years).

            <p>
                This study is one of the first to provide a longitudinal perspective on social media addiction, uniquely
                contributing to the understanding of the long-term impact of parental influence on online behavior. The
                findings suggest that rather than focusing solely on restrictive rules, parents should prioritize open
                communication with adolescents about social media use. This could be a more effective approach to
                preventing problematic behaviors. As social media become even more pervasive, these insights highlight
                the need for ongoing research into the long-term effects of social media use and offer valuable guidance
                for developing interventions aimed at reducing the risk of addiction.

                Authoritarian Parenting
            </h3>
            <p>
                Authoritarian parents typically engage in a 1-way mode of communication where they establish strict
                rules that the child is expected to follow without question or negotiation. These rules are rarely
                explained, and children are expected to meet high standards without making mistakes. Errors are often
                met with punishment. Authoritarian parents tend to be less nurturing, maintaining high expectations with
                limited flexibility.
